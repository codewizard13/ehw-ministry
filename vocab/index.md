# Index for: VOCABULARY & GLOSSARY/

[üèöÔ∏è](../README.md)

According to [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/glossary/), "*A glossary is a section at the end of a written work that defines confusing, technical, or advanced words. You can think of a glossary as a mini-dictionary for words used in that work. Glossaries are commonly used in research papers and academic books to explain special words or jargon readers wouldn‚Äôt understand.*"

Our glossary here is a vocabulary list or a "brief dictionary" organized alphabetically (A-Z). It is not all-inclusive, but rather has definitions for selected terms and concepts that will be most useful for the reader.

### Conventions

- Generic terms will be lower-case by default
- Proper names will be capitalized with title-case (with the exception of brand names and trademarks)
- Acronyms will be upper-case
