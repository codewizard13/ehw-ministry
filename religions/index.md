## What is a Cult?

The word "**[cult](/vocab/index.md#c)**" is a very loaded and controversial term, having significant meaning differences depending on who you ask. For instance, many atheists would classify Christianity (in any form) as a cult. Therefore, I thought it was important that we define what a cult is from a Christian perpective.

The word cult and sect are basically the same, except in the English language, the former has a mostly negative connotation, while the latter a more neutral one.

From a Christian perspective, a cult has at least one of the following characteristics:

- **Theological Deviance:** From a Christian standpoint, a "cult" is often defined as a religious group that deviates significantly from the core doctrines of Christianity. This includes groups that might use Christian terminology but re-interpret key aspects of the faith in ways that are considered heretical by mainstream Christianity. Examples include groups that deny the Trinity, the divinity of Jesus, or salvation by grace.

- **Authority and Scripture:** Christian definitions of a cult may focus on how a group interprets and uses the Bible. A cult might be characterized by an authoritative leader who claims new revelations or interpretations that supersede or contradict the Bible.

- **Community and Control:** The term can also describe groups that exert a high level of control over their members, including their personal lives, to the extent that it stifles individual freedom and critical thinking. This aspect can overlap with psychological and sociological definitions.

- **Spiritual Deception:** For many Christians, a cult is seen as spiritually deceptive, leading people away from the true teachings of Christianity and potentially endangering their souls.
