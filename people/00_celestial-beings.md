### 🧭 Integration Notes

- Each celestial being functions as a **thread through the timeline** rather than a single‑era character.  
- Use links like `[Gabriel → Daniel](01_old-testament.md#d-old-testament)` once anchors exist.  
- Consider adding lightweight **top‑of‑file references** in each human era such as:  
  `_See also celestial counterparts: [Holy Spirit](00_celestial-beings.md#holy-spirit), [Angels](00_celestial-beings.md#angels--heavenly-hosts)._`
